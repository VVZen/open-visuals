# WIP!

As an exercise to learn python, I'm converting some of my previous _The Nature of Code_ sketches in **processing-py**.

Inside *vv-trigo.py* I wrote from scratch all the simple vector math operations needed because my next step will be trying to import the logic inside **Houdini** using a Python SOP to create a small boid simulation.
