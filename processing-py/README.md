# WIP!

As an exercise to learn python, I'm rewriting in [processing-py](http://py.processing.org) some of my previous sketches inspired on the book _The Nature of Code_ by _Daniel Shiffman_.

Inside *vv-trigo.py* I wrote from scratch all the simple vector math operations needed because my next step will be trying to import the logic inside **Houdini** using a Python SOP to create a small boid simulation.
